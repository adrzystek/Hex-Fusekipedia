# Hex-Fusekipedia

Hex is a strategy board game for two players invented independently by Danish mathematician Piet Hein and Nobel prize winner John Nash. In spite of having very simple rules, the game has deep strategy, sharp tactics and a profound mathematical underpinning related to the Brouwer fixed point theorem.

Surprisingly, apart from a few "rules of thumb", there is very little information about how the game should be played. The project Hex Fusekipedia aims to at least partially fill the gap of human unawareness in this matter. This simple application written in Python collects games from all championship tournaments played on Little Golem server which gathers top hex players. Based on these pieces of data, the application shows a variety of opening moves (with their follow-ups) played by the best players. Additional information (e.g., concerning the win ratio for a particular move) is also provided. Everything is wrapped in an user-friendly GUI (made with tkinter package).
